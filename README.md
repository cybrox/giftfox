A bot that uses a lottery system to win free games on steam.

Using it is quite the dick move to be honest, so make sure to also give away games to give the people something back. Using the bot is technically allowed, it shouldn't be overused though.
Since the bot is backed by a cron script, it's up to you how often it should run.
